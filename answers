Refactor the following pseudo code, correct if necessary.

$id = $request['id']; $result = query($conn, "SELECT * FROM testdb WHERE id = $id");

Given the following, What is the value of $b, what is the value of $a, why is that the value?

function doSomething ( &$arg ) { $return = $arg; $arg += 1; return $return; }

$a = 3; $b = doSomething( $a );


the value of $b is 3, and the value of $a is 4, because $a is passed by reference to doSomething(&$arg). 
this function immediately assigns the current value of $arg to $return, then increments the variable that $arg is referencing, and returns $return which holds the original value of $arg (in this case 3).

Parse the included file and output in the format below. This should be a command line tool. Create the parsing code as a library so that it may be used by other applications (Hint: OOP). Bonus (optional): Design so that other file formats (xml, json) can be used in the future with ease.

Use the following format for displaying results from the command line application.

<id> <name> (<quantity>)
- <category 1>
- <category 2>
- <category n...>
Example:

68-OX-YH94 Carrot (5)
- vegetable
- green
- orange
- skinny

Implement a function to convert an integer to roman numeral function. It should allow a custom format for 1 and 5 (e.g. 1=Z, 5=P). Bonus (optional) Use an object oriented approach.
