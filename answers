Refactor the following pseudo code, correct if necessary.

$id = $request['id']; $result = query($conn, "SELECT * FROM testdb WHERE id = $id");

$id = $_REQUEST['id'];
$result = query($conn, "SELECT * FROM testdb WHERE id = '{$id}'");

Given the following, What is the value of $b, what is the value of $a, why is that the value?

function doSomething ( &$arg ) { $return = $arg; $arg += 1; return $return; }

$a = 3; $b = doSomething( $a );


the value of $b is 3, and the value of $a is 4, because $a is passed by reference to doSomething(&$arg). 
this function immediately assigns the current value of $arg to $return, then increments the variable that $arg is referencing, and returns $return which holds the original value of $arg (in this case 3).
