1)
$id = $_REQUEST['id'];
$result = query($conn, "SELECT * FROM testdb WHERE id = '{$id}'");

2)
the value of $b is 3, and the value of $a is 4, because $a is passed by reference to doSomething(&$arg). 
this function immediately assigns the current value of $arg to $return, then increments the variable that $arg is referencing, and returns $return which holds the original value of $arg (in this case 3).

3) code is in file_parser.php

4) code is in int_to_roman.php
